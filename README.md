# NRSC-project
Machine Learning and Computer Vision Participated in the NRSC Offline Coding Challenge(June 3 - July 4, 2025). Built an automated pipeline to generate cloud and shadow masks from Resourcesat-2/2A LISS - IV satellite imagery using unsupervised classification, thresholding, and machine learning techniques, achieving over 90% mask accuracy.
